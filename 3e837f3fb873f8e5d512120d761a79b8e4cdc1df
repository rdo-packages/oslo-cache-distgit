They use different module name, so no collision.\nCurrently, \"python3dist(pymemcache)\" is provided by python3-pymemcache-3.5.0-1.el9s.noarch from our deps repo.\n\nNote that it was added in oslo.cache on Jan 7, 2022 [7].\n\nI think we should keep this new run-time dep, what are your thoughts on this ?\n\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/oslo.cache/blob/ef57c8498538ab8a2a4a29eb866dda1d161c537b/setup.cfg#L40\n[2] https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-pymemcache\n[3] https://github.com/Pinterest/pymemcache\n[4] https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-memcached\n[5] https://github.com/linsomniac/python-memcached/\n[6] https://github.com/linsomniac/python-memcached/commit/5715828a059e4da8c32be9a6cd625072e6bcde74\n[7] https://github.com/openstack/oslo.cache/commit/f4fa6aa6fa2aca23a8f4f9e63c5a57dbcd2d1166",
